    <p>Make pizza dough with rapid-rise yeast instead of buying pre-made dough at the grocery store. It's quick and easy to make from scratch, and it tastes better too.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 envelope Fleischmann's® RapidRise Yeast*</li>
        <li>1 cup very warm water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine 2 cups flour, salt, and yeast in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Stir in very warm water and oil until combined,</li>
        <li>then stir in just enough of remaining 1/2 cup flour to make a soft dough.</li>
        <li>Knead on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            
    </ol>
